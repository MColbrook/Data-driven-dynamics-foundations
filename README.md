# Data-driven-dynamics-foundations

Code for the examples in the paper "Adversarial Dynamical Systems Reveal Limits and Rules for Trustworthy Data-Driven Learning".

Each example has a MATLAB script. The folders algorithms and data_sets contain the main routines and data sets, respectively (see Methods section of the paper). The Arctic Ice data set can be found here: <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/kahihs3ne3zb0kvbri9mp/AD_AEA3aL67alWfW-TJTDdA?rlkey=g0lld5tj5u7845kz9szva8ola&st=stfczjxj&dl=0">Arctic Ice Data</a> and should then be deposited in the data_sets folder.
The sea height data can be found here: <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/vg4tgzos6gt56ooe2l8u0/DATA_north.mat?rlkey=5voj6in71t1n0vbv41fr0jkio&st=5ew4zrkg&dl=0">Sea Height Data</a> and should then be deposited in the data_sets folder.
The cylinder data can be found here: <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/pdnriz6n75fefhyrhvrag/Vorticity_data.mat?rlkey=1w1oydubfkgybs9p0gcx4btsl&st=43ukvjgd&dl=0">Cylinder Data</a> and should then be deposited in the data_sets folder.
