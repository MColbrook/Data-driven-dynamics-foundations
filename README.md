# Data-driven-dynamics-foundations

Code for the examples in the paper "Adversarial Dynamical Systems Reveal Limits and Rules for Trustworthy Data-Driven Learning".

Each example has a MATLAB script. The folders algorithms and data_sets contain the main routines and data sets, respectively (see Methods section of the paper). The Arctic Ice data set can be found here: <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/kahihs3ne3zb0kvbri9mp/AD_AEA3aL67alWfW-TJTDdA?rlkey=g0lld5tj5u7845kz9szva8ola&st=stfczjxj&dl=0">Arctic Ice Data</a> and should then be deposited in the data_sets folder.
